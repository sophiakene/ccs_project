 Dominic Raab has shown he is not only unfit to serve as a Minister but is totally unfit to represent his constituents in Parliament. He should resign as an MP and trigger a by-election so the people of Esher and Walton can finally have the MP they deserve.
 Voters across Surrey and the Blue Wall are fed up with this endless Conservative chaos and MPs who take their communities for granted.

139,"Thurrock is my Borough
The council is bankrupt after a failed borrow to invest scheme left us with over £1B of debt.
The local Tories have control of the council and spent the last 2 years or so doing everything they could to stop anyone seeing the state the finances were in... all the while the debt kept piling up and up.
Credit to the local Labour Party and the local independents for calling for clarity and finally exposing the extent of the problem alongside the Bureau of investigation and local Journalist at Thurrock Nub News.

The 10% council tax rise is mostly to pay down the debt, services are also being cut etc while the taxpayer pays more.

Personally, I'm not opposed to a council tax rise as the area badly needs investment... that we will now being paying more for less is sickening.

Come May, I hope every Tory standing in Thurrock loses their seat... this will still sadly leave the Tories as the majority party here though

 In total 38 principal council by-elections were contested in the first quarter of 2023. The Lib Dems are net up by 5 seats, while the Conservatives are down by 9 councillors.

This continues the By election gains of the Lib Dem’s over the last three years.

Bring forward a fully funded programme to get people who are medically well enough discharged from hospital and set up with appropriate social care and support.   In addition to getting people out of hospital so that they get care in a more comfortable setting, the number of beds in hospitals needs to be increased to end excessive handover delays for ambulances, caused by a lack of bed capacity.   Expand mental health support services to get people the appropriate care they need and reduce the number of call outs for ambulances for mental health reasons.   Pass Daisy Cooper MP’s Ambulance Waiting Times Bill into law that would require  accessible, localised reports of ambulance response times to be published. This would ensure that ‘hot spots’ with some of the longest waiting times can be identified routinely. 12 hour waits at A&E should also be published from arrival at hospital rather than the ‘decision to admit’ as is current practice, so that the true scale of the problem is clear for all to see.",1,libdems

This is an admission of failure from the Prime Minister on behalf of a Conservative Government that has neglected our children's education so badly.  Too many children are being left behind when it comes to maths, and that happens well before they reach 16.  The Prime Minister's words mean nothing without the extra funding and staff to make it happen. You don't need a maths A-Level to know it takes more teachers to teach maths to age 18 than to 16.   Schools are already struggling with a shortage of maths teachers, and the Conservatives have no plan to turn that around.  If Rishi Sunak is serious about reversing the Conservatives' awful record on numeracy, he should start by cancelling the planned cuts to early years education and come forward with a real plan to recruit and retain the teachers we need.",0,libdems

It means electors can vote for their real preference rather that picking the least worst. * It could be argued that PR delivers fairer treatment of minority parties and independent candidates * Under PR fewer votes are ‘wasted’ as more people’s preferences are taken into account * PR potentially offers greater and more-representative choice for voters. * PR may encourage turn-out and reduce apathy. * PR rarely produces an absolute majority for one party, however, it could be argued that PR ensures greater continuity of government and requires greater consensus in policy-making.",2,libdems

Never yield to force; never yield to the apparently overwhelming might of the enemy. We stood all alone a year ago, and to many countries it seemed that our account was closed, we were finished. All this tradition of ours, our songs, our School history, this part of the history of this country, were gone and finished and liquidated.  Very different is the mood today. Britain, other nations thought, had drawn a sponge across her slate. But instead our country stood in the gap. There was no flinching and no thought of giving in; and by what seemed almost a miracle to those outside these Islands, though we ourselves never doubted it, we now find ourselves in a position where I say that we can be sure that we have only to persevere to conquer.”  Speech to Harrow, 1941 ",1,conservatives

I have never understood how this all got started to the extent that a Government is responsible for feeding other people's children. I know people are broke, I understand that, I grew up with a single mum who fed us basic food before and after school and made us a sandwich for our lunch. Now, mothers are sending their kids out of their home for food on a permanent basis. I have had dealings with young children at my work and many of them openly said that they only ever eat at school or, on the weekend, at McDonalds. And don't start saying that ""food is expensive"" because I shop carefully and see a loaf of bread reduced to 32 pence, a tub of spread at the regular price of under a pound and peanut butter at the regular price of 85 pence. Two chicken legs at Marks and Spencer, full price, at £1.35 yesterday at the Kensington High Street M&S branch. It seems that mothers have simply given up even trying. My mum sat us three kids down, told us we were in money trouble and that we would just have to do our best. I learned that as 9 year old and I still shop that way.
