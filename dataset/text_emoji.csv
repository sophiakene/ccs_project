🟡 Voters across Surrey and the Blue Wall are fed up with this endless Conservative chaos and MPs who take their communities for granted.

69,"Thurrock is my Borough
The council is bankrupt after a failed borrow to invest scheme left us with over £1B of debt.
The local Tories have control of the council and spent the last 2 years or so doing everything they could to stop anyone seeing the state the finances were in... all the while the debt kept piling up and up.
Credit to the local Labour Party and the local independents for calling for clarity and finally exposing the extent of the problem alongside the Bureau of investigation and local Journalist at Thurrock Nub News.

The 10% council tax rise is mostly to pay down the debt, services are also being cut etc while the taxpayer pays more.

Personally, I'm not opposed to a council tax rise as the area badly needs investment... that we will now being paying more for less is sickening.

Come May, I hope every Tory standing in Thurrock loses their seat... this will still sadly leave the Tories as the majority party here though 😔

This would ensure that ‘hot spots’ with some of the longest waiting times can be identified routinely. 12 hour waits at A&E should also be published from arrival at hospital rather than the ‘decision to admit’ as is current practice, so that the true scale of the problem is clear for all to see.",1,libdems

157,"🗳️ Advantages of Proportional Representation (PR) * Moving to PR would give minority parties and independent candidates a better chance of winning seats in Parliament. * Candidates would be elected in the basis of a proportion of the votes cast rather than less than 50%.  * Voters would have a choice of representatives more sympathetic to their political views and social condition.  * PR ensures that the parties would have to appeal to their core supporters, rather than a small number of so called ‘swing voters’ in marginal seats. It means electors can vote for their real preference rather that picking the least worst. * It could be argued that PR delivers fairer treatment of minority parties and independent candidates * Under PR fewer votes are ‘wasted’ as more people’s preferences are taken into account * PR potentially offers greater and more-representative choice for voters. * PR may encourage turn-out and reduce apathy. * PR rarely produces an absolute majority for one party, however, it could be argued that PR ensures greater continuity of government and requires greater consensus in policy-making.",2,libdems

Never yield to force; never yield to the apparently overwhelming might of the enemy. We stood all alone a year ago, and to many countries it seemed that our account was closed, we were finished. All this tradition of ours, our songs, our School history, this part of the history of this country, were gone and finished and liquidated.  Very different is the mood today. Britain, other nations thought, had drawn a sponge across her slate. But instead our country stood in the gap. There was no flinching and no thought of giving in; and by what seemed almost a miracle to those outside these Islands, though we ourselves never doubted it, we now find ourselves in a position where I say that we can be sure that we have only to persevere to conquer.”  Speech to Harrow, 1941 🥃🇬🇧",1,conservatives

I have never understood how this all got started to the extent that a Government is responsible for feeding other people's children. I know people are broke, I understand that, I grew up with a single mum who fed us basic food before and after school and made us a sandwich for our lunch. Now, mothers are sending their kids out of their home for food on a permanent basis. I have had dealings with young children at my work and many of them openly said that they only ever eat at school or, on the weekend, at McDonalds. And don't start saying that ""food is expensive"" because I shop carefully and see a loaf of bread reduced to 32 pence, a tub of spread at the regular price of under a pound and peanut butter at the regular price of 85 pence. Two chicken legs at Marks and Spencer, full price, at £1.35 yesterday at the Kensington High Street M&S branch. It seems that mothers have simply given up even trying. My mum sat us three kids down, told us we were in money trouble and that we would just have to do our best. I learned that as 9 year old and I still shop that way.

They expect nurses,  carers and teachers to survive this inflation with their original wages when 100pound shopping is nothing anymore 🤔...I hope people wake up to understand that there is not a shortage of nurses or doctors or carers, there is only a government happy to pay them less and import cheaper labour...Agency workers are the same permanently employed nurses they refuse to pay properly doing the same job fir higher wage at the expense of the tax payers whilst the agents rake in billions in profit",0,labour
