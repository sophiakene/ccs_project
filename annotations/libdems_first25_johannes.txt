1   Lib Dems, just following the band wagon. Never leading with new ideas, or initiatives to make the party stand out. Very disappointing.😒   neg

2   Intimidation, persistent aggression in workplace relationships, abuse of misuse of power is very common even in company’s trying to be conformist with government toxic emotional bankruptcy. The level of covering all this above gross misconducts by powerful individuals in big companies is disgusting. Even I have had gathered many evidence of this on big projects but for 3 years all my whistleblowing was left with no ground and eventually I was a victim of distress by people at power. Only my family and LibDem’s has been helping me 🧡   pos

4   🔶🟡 Raab resigns: By-election now
🟡 Dominic Raab has shown he is not only unfit to serve as a Minister but is totally unfit to represent his constituents in Parliament. He should resign as an MP and trigger a by-election so the people of Esher and Walton can finally have the MP they deserve.
🟡 Voters across Surrey and the Blue Wall are fed up with this endless Conservative chaos and MPs who take their communities for granted. At the next election in Esher and Walton, it will be a two horse race between more Conservative party chaos or a hardworking Liberal Democrat MP who will listen and stand up for local people.”   neg

11   Freedom to dump 💩 in the English river system. All for 💰💰. Then underfunded all council operated public baths. Let's make all our children learn maths until they are 18. Now which movement in the last century was obsessed with numbers. All they saw was numbers , and they loved a relocation camp or two as well. Maybe we should make our children learn history until they are 16.   neg

15   If they didn't have to investigate so many complaints that a FB post caused offence, or a dolly in a pub made some little mommy's darling cry while he was having a glass of warm milk, then perhaps they could investigate crime. But hey, liberal feelings matter 🥴   neg

18   🔶🟡NHS Waiting Lists
🟡 : The number of people waiting for NHS treatment has risen to a new record high of 7.22 million.
🟡 : Rishi Sunak’s NHS pledge is already turning out to be yet another broken Conservative promise. They have let the NHS crisis spiral out of control, failing to deliver the new hospitals they promised and making people wait months or even years for treatment.
🟡 : We need an urgent rescue plan for the NHS. If patients could see their GP when they need to or get the care they need at home, it would free up hospital resources to treat people far more quickly.   neg

22   Labour shambles - giving the Bank of England independence to dictate what our pay packet affords us , how large the wealth divide is !
And make years of working 6 days a wk totally fruitless as the currency you trade your work , sweat and toil for ,just gets dilited to transfer wealth to the rich asset holders !
Labour are a bloody shambles and responsible for the detriment many are suffering now from profiteering being sustained by the wealth divide that inflicts more hardship on the have nots !
If you support Labour hold your head in shame 👍
All that is wrong right now is down to the Labour party completely !
So if it’s out of Labour or the LIB’s then vote LIB’s and not the disaster Labour Party   neg

23   If they made access to facilities easier and cheaper then it would curb the issue.
