1	Yay! Does that mean you're ditching Blairite neoliberalism for Corbyn styled Democratic Socialism? 😉 2

2	Didn't the tories just say they want to take the doctors pensions to force them to work longer into retirement 😂 0

3	This Government is ripping off British Tax payers money spending on terrorism, making British people suffer into poverty and force people pension age up by a year, now commit criminals offences by force elderly people to work. This government is sick and EVIL 😈  0

4	The NHS has finished unfortunately. Very sad. 😭😭  0

5	Rishi Sunak Conservatives stop halal cruelty in our country it’s offensive to the British people to have halal killings in our country we don’t want it it’s cruelty to animals i thought we tackled that a long time ago 🤔  0

8	Have you got the demographics to illustrate the words you use above ☝️  1

9	So paying 20% tax on every pound earned once going over the 12k threshold due to fiscal drag & a £40,000 pension boost to the better off is somehow somebody else's responsibility?
🤷 Announcing thing's that aren't actually in the budget are obviously of no use to people already paying through the nose for the highest energy costs in Europe.  1

10	I'm sure the former 'Well Paid' Longbridge Rover plant workers appreciate not having to drive to work on bumpy roads as they now walk to work in their minimum wage supermarket jobs . . . . . LOL.🤪

I suspect those who now live in the grossly overpriced rentier flats now on the site who can't afford a £200 'Highway Heap' off eBay due to hading 70% of their income to landlords on top of the 45% Neo-Fasfinancis

30	🔶🟡 Junior Doctors’ Strike:
Recall Parliament
🟡 Thousands of operations are set to be cancelled and patients’ lives could be put at risk because of the government’s failure to resolve the four-day junior doctors strike this week.
🟡 By refusing to talk to junior doctors, Steve Barclay is putting our NHS and thousands of patients at unnecessary risk. We need to recall Parliament so Conservative Ministers can be held to account over this sudden refusal to engage in talks.
🟡 The Government needs to get round the table immediately to resolve this impending crisis facing our NHS. NHS staff deserve a fair deal but this Health Secretary has slammed the door on urgent talks. 1

31	🙏🙏  2

32	Why do people in Scotland pay more for the standing charge than the rest of the UK? 🤡  0

33	🤣And this is what happens when the UK have deluded and incompetent political leaders.. Have they not worked out what's happening. The more money we give the French, they increase their numbers of police on the north coast and yet more boats keep coming.
Ask yourself why!
The police crackdown on crime in that area, and also make it hard for the migrants. This makes them more determined to get to the UK. But you would think that there would now be a shortage of small boats in the north of France? 🤔Not if UK money is also being sidelined to pay for the boats! Let's be honest, I would be very surprised if this is not happening because it solves the problems on the French side.
Macron has often openly voiced his distain for the UK on many occasions and he must be laughing so much at our desperation and stupidity for giving him so much of our tax payers money.
For Rishi to see this as a success just show why he should not be in office.  0

41	Lol next Labour will be vowing to save Blockbusters! 🤣. Note Sadiq Khan meanwhile is killing off the highest of greater London with his expanded ULEZ. 0

42	How does freezing it "save" drivers £100 a year? Surely it just means drivers are paying the same as they do now? 🤷🏼‍♂️ 1

43	Meanwhile...in Croydon the local labour party were asked by the central party to abstain from voting down our 15% rise so it passed. Thanks for that 👍🏻 0

44	They are leaving so called England and emigrating to Spain who lives there now just as many English then Spanish but much harder now being out of eu unbelievably people are not realising this I would have been one of those if we had not come out of eu it’s now going to take me 5 years to become a resident 😂 1

45	Notice ZERO has been mentioned about dragging the millions of people out of the poverty Torys have created for them.

52	Halving inflation is a given - Even by doing nothing. Inflation stops but prices will still be sky high.

Growing the economy - again you would have to try hard not to. It’s basically static now.

Reducing dept - who’s? Not the publics I bet.

Cutting waiting lists - how?

Stopping the boats - thrown in to keep the Little Britain’s happy 🤦🏻‍♂️ 0

53	This would be more encouraging if you would say exactly how much you have delivered. To be more specific:

1. By how much have you reduced inflation?
2. By how much have you grown the economy?
3. By how much have you reduced debt?
4. By how much have you cut waiting lists?
5. How many boats have you stopped? By “stopped”, we mean stopped from entering the country. Stopped and then transported to a hotel in Britain doesn’t count.

With the local elections on the horizon, it would be useful if you would provide answers and evidence of delivery as soon as possible 👍  1

57	Johnson wanted a high wage economy, Tories now complaining that nurses are wanting higher wages!🤦‍♀️ 0

58	Just remind everybody here who caused this food shortages in 1st place its not brexit and its not shortage off foreign workers now . Which government halved farm numbers in there term off government. What was Tony's words we will import our food from France and our wine from Italy and our farmers will be groundsmen keeping the fields green like a lawn or words to that effect 10s off thousands off farmers packed in from 1997 to 2010 we never had food issues or worker issues in 60s 70s 80s 90s as we had a workforce called farmers they grew the food and it didn't root in fields as it got done . But they are now long gone and not replaced and the generations off skills are gone . Good plan that was labour and Tony 👍👍👍. No the country is paying a high price for it . Lack off food and lack off farmers left and your using brexit and immigration from a 25 year ago policy off labour plan to import food rather than produce it .  0

69	And will it be cheaper for everyone I very much doubt it. Think we all have we all realise think it's going to be the norm now high heating costs. 🤔 1

70	Thurrock is my Borough
The council is bankrupt after a failed borrow to invest scheme left us with over £1B of debt.
The local Tories have control of the council and spent the last 2 years or so doing everything they could to stop anyone seeing the state the finances were in... all the while the debt kept piling up and up.
Credit to the local Labour Party and the local independents for calling for clarity and finally exposing the extent of the problem alongside the Bureau of investigation and local Journalist at Thurrock Nub News.

The 10% council tax rise is mostly to pay down the debt, services are also being cut etc while the taxpayer pays more.

Personally, I'm not opposed to a council tax rise as the area badly needs investment... that we will now being paying more for less is sickening.

Come May, I hope every Tory standing in Thurrock loses their seat... this will still sadly leave the Tories as the majority party here though 😔

87	Will Labour do this really? Or will Labour just ban or exclude people with draughty homes? After all the latter would be so much cheaper wouldn't it? If people still insist on having drafty homes and won't be excluded or expelled, then Labour might at least seek to pass legislation to stop them boring others by debating their draughty homes? 🤷🏻‍♂️🤷🏽‍♂️🤷🏿‍♂️ 0

88	👏👏👏👏Conservatives. M  2

89	CEOs of 💧 water companies earn millions per year to pollute and waste 🤦‍♀️ No other country has privatised water 💦 0

90	Late to the issue again. It is almost like an election is due🤔.  0

91	It really does show how too much money can cause a huge lack of common sense when it comes to voting!🤷‍♂️  0

92	Is this just because they're low density suburban and rural areas with big houses so they need more council tax per house? 🧐 Whereas labour areas are high density metropolitan areas that make money off other stuff like parking charges and business rates so naturally need less? Which would mean that this is basically a non-point? 1

93	I see an awful lot of spending, but no way to pay for it all. Any more printing of money will see a further collapse of the banking sector. SVB didn't just collapse because it was woke: it was playing a shell game with investor's money. 🤨 0

94	100% clean energy by 2030 that is literally impossible, there isn’t the money or time. You do know that’s a little over 6 years to close all the old power stations and build new ones 😂😂😂😂

101	Keir Starmer has abandoned his pledges to defend trade unions, bring key industries into public ownership, reverse NHS privatisation, raise corporation tax, protect free movement and abolish tuition fees. Solidarity is now saved for CEOs, not striking workers. Trust is placed in corporate interests, not party members. 🎯

Human rights issues are cherry picked at the expense of a consistently ethical foreign policy. And empathy for desperate refugees is eschewed to appease the right-wing press. 🎯

As the government plunges millions into hardship, Keir Starmer has decided to attack the democratic foundations of his own party and the principles he once proclaimed to support. 🎯 0

If you want to fix the NHS, the GP system should be one of if not the first item on the agenda. Fix this and you reduce people's need to go to hospitals for things they shouldn't be going to the hospital with, this reduces the stress on our hospitals, reducing queues and wait times... It's not hard to work out!!! The state of the NHS, which the Tory's are directly responsible for, is no laughing matter 😞  2

255	Dear Labour Party,

How on earth do you seriously think you can maintain this pledge when retention is the issue, particularly amongst newly qualified GPs?

Perhaps you should focus less on meaningless sound bites and more on an actual solution, that doesn’t involve removing the independent contractor status of GP partners as per Wes Streeting’s deepest desire!

327	Still good for street art though right 😊👍 2

328	That’s nice, but then you want to Increase the State Pension Age 🤷 1

329	First time for everything 😂 What a gimmick whilst the Government has already been saving households thousands £s. You can’t take what’s not there - most of profit is abroad which we can’t tax. 1

330	LOL. What you meant to say was “our priorities are your priorities” 😉😉  1

331	🔶🟡 Lib Dems have made a flying start
to 2023 in council by-elections.
🟡 Between January and March we scored an impressive 6 by-election gains - and increased our vote share across all wards contested by 6.4%. That's the biggest vote share rise of any party - and by some margin too!
🟡 In total 38 principal council by-elections were contested in the first quarter of 2023. The Lib Dems are net up by 5 seats, while the Conservatives are down by 9 councillors.

This continues the By election gains of the Lib Dem’s over the last three years.

346	And we are the brink of smashung the all time employment record! Well done Rishi and Co. 🙂 2

347	Its not that these are bad ideas...
Unworkable, possibly, but not terrible ideas...

Its more that, they aren't really getting to the roots of problems. They are superficial sticking plasters designed for little more than splashing across Social Media and sending out in emails to create the illusion that (after 13yrs of aggravating problems) you are taking action.
They are shiny, glittery distractions with no substance 🤷🏻‍♀️ 0

348	Is that first guy Mike 'The Gapes of Wrath' Gapes? 😂 1

Aspiration is rewarded  1

350	Lots of budding MP’s out there. 🤔  2

351	Smoke and mirrors - only a conservative politician could turn inflation rates of 2.040% (July 21) into an inflation rate of 11.52% (October 22) and then claim some kind of moral high ground by pledging to halve the current rate!! #unbelievable 🤬  0

352	My GP surgery are fantastic. Long wait for appointments (around 2weeks) but if you know you have regular ones it’s fine. Labour are actively involved in these strikes because they think it gives them extra votes for the election 😡 0

353	😘  2

354	All mainstream political parties are out of touch with the normal person , as well as out of ideas. Personally I cant see any positives from any of them being in power. Come election day it will be a case of close my eyes and randomly picking a party 🤔 0

362	After 13 years of Tory onslaught on working class people, of increasing corruption, tax evasion, greed and grinding poverty, this is what Labour propose! Shouldn’t Labour be much stronger, bolder and ambitious! Shouldn’t they want the fair and just redistribution of wealth, and to build a better society? I think people will feel that voting is a waste of time, given that they won’t feel Labour have much interest in them, if they have so little to offer… ☹️😥☹️😥☹️  0

363	They don't need to stop the small boats as Mr sunak is going to do that before the end of the year dah 🤔 0

372	I am British from Tenerife with no passport OOO but l get a boat from Calais no problem 👍and accommodation 🍾🍾🍾🍾🍾👍 Tories have had 11 year to get this sorted out 1

373	Hearing kier's plans for a national bank is very exciting, i do think that labour can build our country's future, the national bank idea 🤔 i think kier said the money would be for projects around the country and green projects,I'd go further and create a retail bank for the British people for the nation owned by the nation just for people's wages to go into so to prevent the corporate banks ever putting our financial system in jeopardy again with greedy gambles that the tax payer is still paying for today, i think a national bank can operate along side corporate banks and a capitalist system obviously not everyone will want to bank there if if that type of bank was created people would have a choice because of savings will be better in the private sector but those that would put their money into a new styled national bank would know that if they did bank with a new national bank like i described Thier wages at least would be safe and fire walled and not just up to 50.000 but all the way up to Thier total amount which actually would be great for wealthy people as well, then when the banks get greedy again people's wages and pensions and wealth would be safe and we wouldn't need to bailout the hedge funds next time, obviously in the case of another banking crisis forbid the government would have to bailout the big banks because of our financial system but people's wages wouldn't be on the line if we had a national bank separate from corporate banking (a fail safe) 😌 just my idea.  1

374	Wouldn't trust you to deliver a pizza 🤷‍♂️ 0

375	But is that money going into the supermarket and investors and not the farmers ?🤔 that deserve the funding the most. 1

380	Try having a word with the Labour run city council under Peter Soulsby.
Our city and estates are beginning to look like a 💩 hole.
The estate I live on has houses that foreigners have bought and they look like building sites for the last two years. It might be acceptable in their own country, but not here.
Fly tipping is an everyday occurrence.
Shopping trolleys all over the estate.
Try talking to the council about it and there is someone on the other end of the phone who’s English is not the best.
My wife was asked if we were council tenants when reporting fly tipping on the estate. When she said no, the council employee said well there might be a problem.
Trying to explain we rent privately was a non starter. She simply didn’t understand how we privately rent on a council estate.
You really have no idea what goes on in the world that is a million miles away from yours.
The roads are covered in potholes, one road through the estate is actually sinking.
As for antisocial behaviour. The only time you see the police is when they get lost looking for the police station or MacDonalds.🤬🤬🤬 0

387	Laughable. The reality, the number of Environmental Protection Officers slashed by two thirds, no fines levied (except one relating to an incident a decade old), and the plan to clean up our rivers by 2027... pushed back to 2062!

Our rivers are dying 😥. That's the reality, 'Conservatives'
