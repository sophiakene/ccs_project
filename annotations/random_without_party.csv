104,"🔶🟡 Ambulance Crisis - 5 Point Winter Plan 🟡 Launch a campaign to retain, recruit and train paramedics and other ambulance service staff.  🟡 Bring forward a fully funded programme to get people who are medically well enough discharged from hospital and set up with appropriate social care and support.  🟡 In addition to getting people out of hospital so that they get care in a more comfortable setting, the number of beds in hospitals needs to be increased to end excessive handover delays for ambulances, caused by a lack of bed capacity.  🟡 Expand mental health support services to get people the appropriate care they need and reduce the number of call outs for ambulances for mental health reasons.  🟡 Pass Daisy Cooper MP’s Ambulance Waiting Times Bill into law that would require  accessible, localised reports of ambulance response times to be published. This would ensure that ‘hot spots’ with some of the longest waiting times can be identified routinely. 12 hour waits at A&E should also be published from arrival at hospital rather than the ‘decision to admit’ as is current practice, so that the true scale of the problem is clear for all to see.",2023-01-12T13:14:04+0000,1

157,"🗳️ Advantages of Proportional Representation (PR) * Moving to PR would give minority parties and independent candidates a better chance of winning seats in Parliament. * Candidates would be elected in the basis of a proportion of the votes cast rather than less than 50%.  * Voters would have a choice of representatives more sympathetic to their political views and social condition.  * PR ensures that the parties would have to appeal to their core supporters, rather than a small number of so called ‘swing voters’ in marginal seats. It means electors can vote for their real preference rather that picking the least worst. * It could be argued that PR delivers fairer treatment of minority parties and independent candidates * Under PR fewer votes are ‘wasted’ as more people’s preferences are taken into account * PR potentially offers greater and more-representative choice for voters. * PR may encourage turn-out and reduce apathy. * PR rarely produces an absolute majority for one party, however, it could be argued that PR ensures greater continuity of government and requires greater consensus in policy-making.",2023-01-03T11:11:04+0000,2

The best way to avoid disruption is to prevent these strikes in the first place, which means getting round the table with staff and employers to find a solution. 🟡: This looks like another attempt by the Conservatives to distract from their appalling mismanagement of the economy and from their failure to avert strikes in the first place. 🟡🔶🧡 We’ll be carefully scrutinising this legislation.

All this tradition of ours, our songs, our School history, this part of the history of this country, were gone and finished and liquidated.  Very different is the mood today. Britain, other nations thought, had drawn a sponge across her slate. But instead our country stood in the gap. There was no flinching and no thought of giving in; and by what seemed almost a miracle to those outside these Islands, though we ourselves never doubted it, we now find ourselves in a position where I say that we can be sure that we have only to persevere to conquer.”  Speech to Harrow, 1941 🥃🇬🇧",2022-11-30T19:52:48+0000,*

I have never understood how this all got started to the extent that a Government is responsible for feeding other people's children. I know people are broke, I understand that, I grew up with a single mum who fed us basic food before and after school and made us a sandwich for our lunch. Now, mothers are sending their kids out of their home for food on a permanent basis. I have had dealings with young children at my work and many of them openly said that they only ever eat at school or, on the weekend, at McDonalds. And don't start saying that ""food is expensive"" because I shop carefully and see a loaf of bread reduced to 32 pence, a tub of spread at the regular price of under a pound and peanut butter at the regular price of 85 pence. Two chicken legs at Marks and Spencer, full price, at £1.35 yesterday at the Kensington High Street M&S branch. It seems that mothers have simply given up even trying. My mum sat us three kids down, told us we were in money trouble and that we would just have to do our best. I learned that as 9 year old and I still shop that way.

38,"Instead of the UK government to review salaries of nurses, carers, teachers they resort to importing these skills from abroad! They recruit from abroad because in the short term of 5years, the imported skills would be satisfied with low wages until they become citizens and then suddenly want more money...I am honestly counting down to the next election to see conservatives gotten rid of! Useless bunch of individuals..they are ok to inflate council taxes but not salaries 😳😳! They expect nurses,  carers and teachers to survive this inflation with their original wages when 100pound shopping is nothing anymore 🤔...I hope people wake up to understand that there is not a shortage of nurses or doctors or carers, there is only a government happy to pay them less and import cheaper labour...Agency workers are the same permanently employed nurses they refuse to pay properly doing the same job fir higher wage at the expense of the tax payers whilst the agents rake in billions in profit",2022-12-13T12:54:43+0000,*
