This would ensure that ‘hot spots’ with some of the longest waiting times can be identified routinely. 12 hour waits at A&E should also be published from arrival at hospital rather than the ‘decision to admit’ as is current practice, so that the true scale of the problem is clear for all to see.",2023-01-12T13:14:04+0000

1026,"🗳️ Advantages of Proportional Representation (PR) * Moving to PR would give minority parties and independent candidates a better chance of winning seats in Parliament. * Candidates would be elected in the basis of a proportion of the votes cast rather than less than 50%.  * Voters would have a choice of representatives more sympathetic to their political views and social condition.  * PR ensures that the parties would have to appeal to their core supporters, rather than a small number of so called ‘swing voters’ in marginal seats. It means electors can vote for their real preference rather that picking the least worst. * It could be argued that PR delivers fairer treatment of minority parties and independent candidates * Under PR fewer votes are ‘wasted’ as more people’s preferences are taken into account * PR potentially offers greater and more-representative choice for voters. * PR may encourage turn-out and reduce apathy. * PR rarely produces an absolute majority for one party, however, it could be argued that PR ensures greater continuity of government and requires greater consensus in policy-making.",2023-01-03T11:11:04+0000

1112,"Pardon me for asking but WHY are mothers sending their own children to school without as much as a slice of toast and peanut butter in their stomachs and expecting the British Education System to become a catering organisation? I have never understood how this all got started to the extent that a Government is responsible for feeding other people's children. I know people are broke, I understand that, I grew up with a single mum who fed us basic food before and after school and made us a sandwich for our lunch. Now, mothers are sending their kids out of their home for food on a permanent basis. I have had dealings with young children at my work and many of them openly said that they only ever eat at school or, on the weekend, at McDonalds. And don't start saying that ""food is expensive"" because I shop carefully and see a loaf of bread reduced to 32 pence, a tub of spread at the regular price of under a pound and peanut butter at the regular price of 85 pence. Two chicken legs at Marks and Spencer, full price, at £1.35 yesterday at the Kensington High Street M&S branch. It seems that mothers have simply given up even trying. My mum sat us three kids down, told us we were in money trouble and that we would just have to do our best. I learned that as 9 year old and I still shop that way. There is more to being a 'mother' than giving birth, there is 'parenting' after and for years. ""A child is not just for benefits."" 🫣",2023-01-04T13:12:25+0000
