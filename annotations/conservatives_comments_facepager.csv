1915,It’s a shame you let the small businesses down from the start. You need to fix the strikes going on now which will do more damage than you can imagine.  I do semi support the unions for better conditions but I think doing what they are doing now is counter productive to All working people. Maybe an idea would be a planned general strike in January forewarned and planned to send a message to the government that things need to change. This would not disrupt the average working person or small business during the festive period.

Never yield to force; never yield to the apparently overwhelming might of the enemy. We stood all alone a year ago, and to many countries it seemed that our account was closed, we were finished. All this tradition of ours, our songs, our School history, this part of the history of this country, were gone and finished and liquidated.  Very different is the mood today. Britain, other nations thought, had drawn a sponge across her slate. But instead our country stood in the gap. There was no flinching and no thought of giving in; and by what seemed almost a miracle to those outside these Islands, though we ourselves never doubted it, we now find ourselves in a position where I say that we can be sure that we have only to persevere to conquer.”  Speech to Harrow, 1941 🥃🇬🇧",2022-11-30T19:52:48+0000

2466,"Milions of Undocument legal migrants Living in uk.... after 10 years grant amnesty and reduce 20 year ILR rule ❤️  The Government should grant amnesty to undocumented migrants who have been living in the UK for 10 years or more, and reduce the 20 year residence rule for Indefinite Leave to Remain (ILR). This should be decreased to 14 years. It is unjust.  In this difficult time those people really stuggling ,they can speak engish ,they know culture and they have lots of work experience why can't they contribute the economy.  The Hostile Environment that faces people on their arrival in the UK extends to those who have been here for years trying to make a living. Undocumented migrants – the majority of whom arrived through legal routes but have fallen out of legal status   now whats happening hiring law skill imigrant including lots of dependants from every country,and its make really harmfull for the country long term. please consider my sensible request and give them status,minimum allow them to swich to some sort of working visa category,this way they must work,pay tax for continue status and renew visa. they need life aswell, make them pay tax,rather than working in black market,This is the best quikest way to sort out labor shortage aswell....
