1   Lib Dems, just following the band wagon. Never leading with new ideas, or initiatives to make the party stand out. Very disappointing.😒	0

2   Intimidation, persistent aggression in workplace relationships, abuse of misuse of power is very common even in company’s trying to be conformist with government toxic emotional bankruptcy. The level of covering all this above gross misconducts by powerful individuals in big companies is disgusting. Even I have had gathered many evidence of this on big projects but for 3 years all my whistleblowing was left with no ground and eventually I was a victim of distress by people at power. Only my family and LibDem’s has been helping me 🧡	2

4   🔶🟡 Raab resigns: By-election now
🟡 Dominic Raab has shown he is not only unfit to serve as a Minister but is totally unfit to represent his constituents in Parliament. He should resign as an MP and trigger a by-election so the people of Esher and Walton can finally have the MP they deserve.
🟡 Voters across Surrey and the Blue Wall are fed up with this endless Conservative chaos and MPs who take their communities for granted. At the next election in Esher and Walton, it will be a two horse race between more Conservative party chaos or a hardworking Liberal Democrat MP who will listen and stand up for local people.”	0

11   Freedom to dump 💩 in the English river system. All for 💰💰. Then underfunded all council operated public baths. Let's make all our children learn maths until they are 18.

Maybe we should make our children learn history until they are 16.	0

15   If they didn't have to investigate so many complaints that a FB post caused offence, or a dolly in a pub made some little mommy's darling cry while he was having a glass of warm milk, then perhaps they could investigate crime. But hey, liberal feelings matter 🥴	0

18   🔶🟡NHS Waiting Lists
🟡 : The number of people waiting for NHS treatment has risen to a new record high of 7.22 million.
🟡 : Rishi Sunak’s NHS pledge is already turning out to be yet another broken Conservative promise. They have let the NHS crisis spiral out of control, failing to deliver the new hospitals they promised and making people wait months or even years for treatment.
🟡 : We need an urgent rescue plan for the NHS. If patients could see their GP when they need to or get the care they need at home, it would free up hospital resources to treat people far more quickly.	0

22   Labour shambles - giving the Bank of England independence to dictate what our pay packet affords us , how large the wealth divide is !
And make years of working 6 days a wk totally fruitless as the currency you trade your work , sweat and toil for ,just gets dilited to transfer wealth to the rich asset holders !
Labour are a bloody shambles and responsible for the detriment many are suffering now from profiteering being sustained by the wealth divide that inflicts more hardship on the have nots !
If you support Labour hold your head in shame 👍
All that is wrong right now is down to the Labour party completely !
So if it’s out of Labour or the LIB’s then vote LIB’s and not the disaster Labour Party	0

23   If they made access to facilities easier and cheaper then it would curb the issue.
Local authorities are partly to blame.
They make it a nightmare for a homeowner to take rubbish to a legitimate tip... 🤠	0

2	Desperately need more health visitors to ensure people can stay at home *& not take up hospital beds . Also checking more on new borns at home to help new parents adjust to huge demands of parenting. District nurses can pick up on early signs of dysfunctional families / child abuse and neglect. Hopefully then be able to provide support services. As such reducing the huge increase in baby deaths at hands of parents. / step parents 💔	1

3	What has the tories prehistoric capitalism done for us in over 40yrs? Apart from stealing all our industry which WE paid for and sold off on the cheap to their mates, they have put us TRILLIONS in debt while they are the richest they HAVE EVER BEEN. Everything crumbling from the NHS to the roads which are a disgrace🤬so keep voting for the tories thieving capitalism and keep the 1% very happy ! NO CLAUSE 4, NO LABOUR PARTY.	0

4	Nothing can be guaranteed 💯. Perhaps rephrase and say "We will try"	1

7	Admirable stuff but they’re setting themselves up for a fall. You can tax all you like but it’s not going to magic 🪄 up the staff to fulfil these promises	0

8	In your local elections vote 💚 green. Don't let the Tories be they blue or red privatise the NHS	1

9	What will Labour pay these Doctors and nurses? 🤔 It needs to be a lot closer to what they are asking for. So far Labour have not said what they will do with regards to pay.	1

11	Phew a lot of financial quotes here..including

quantitive easing
....wow....NHS ????
but
Best of all the deputy leader of the Labour Party, for the whole of 2023, so far. has said. Nothing.
Our "street talking" Ange has kept her comments to herself, and 'got on' with the hundreds ? of jobs, she get expenses for, within her remit.
Go Girl...........
😞 sorry
or what ever gender she chooses at this time.

▪️He's on the side of the Tories	0

13	Voting for the Labour Party and their really excellent candidates in local and general elections and getting them elected to majority power will be the way these issues are addressed and eventually remedied. The ballot box is the way to rid us of the Tories and 13 years of poverty, punishment and pain inflicted on us by them. If you want a fairer society, vote Labour every time.

14	Labours NHS was £6.9trillions (today’s rates) in defecit within 12 months of its existence and NO Government was ever been able to balance the books and find the NHS properly..... and a LIEBOUR Government wontvbe able to either so stop the 🐂💩	0

15	What do you propose to do to rectify this? It won't happen overnight 🤔	1

16	The Labour Party are you going to wave a magic wand 🪄. You need to beware of offering too much that is unachievable you can tax all you want but it’s not going to get the staff you require any time soon	0

20	I hate the Tories always been labour but would they be able to do any better in the current situation. People are scared to be ill. Have a fall. Heart attack. Stroke. Because the ambulance wouldn't reach them on time. It's all so sad what we have become. I know a elderly lady who had a fall broke her pelvis and she walked somehow down to the hospital. The staff said they don't know how she did it she must have been in so much pain. 😪	0

21	Is anyone convinced with this 💩?	0

22	Maybe you need to accept responsibility also for the support you provided the government with covid measures that led to huge NHS backlogs and waiting lists in the first place ? Maybe accept responsibility for your support of compulsory vaccination that has led to an increase in heart attacks and strokes too ? . The whole lot of you have blood on your hands and it will take more than a few false promises to put right what you helped cause 😭 x	0

10	I've driven all over the country and I can name 30 other areas that are so much more congested than the areas covered by the new ulez zones but such areas have no charges. I barely see 100 cars down my road in a day yet that fool wants to tax us to drive on them. A stupid man voted in by stupid Londoners. Pathetic 😡	0
