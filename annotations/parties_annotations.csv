The council is bankrupt after a failed borrow to invest scheme left us with over £1B of debt.
The local Tories have control of the council and spent the last 2 years or so doing everything they could to stop anyone seeing the state the finances were in... all the while the debt kept piling up and up.
Credit to the local Labour Party and the local independents for calling for clarity and finally exposing the extent of the problem alongside the Bureau of investigation and local Journalist at Thurrock Nub News.

The 10% council tax rise is mostly to pay down the debt, services are also being cut etc while the taxpayer pays more.

Personally, I'm not opposed to a council tax rise as the area badly needs investment... that we will now being paying more for less is sickening.

439,"🔶🟡 Junior Doctors’ Strike:
Recall Parliament
🟡 Thousands of operations are set to be cancelled and patients’ lives could be put at risk because of the government’s failure to resolve the four-day junior doctors strike this week.
🟡 By refusing to talk to junior doctors, Steve Barclay is putting our NHS and thousands of patients at unnecessary risk. We need to recall Parliament so Conservative Ministers can be held to account over this sudden refusal to engage in talks.
🟡 The Government needs to get round the table immediately to resolve this impending crisis facing our NHS. NHS staff deserve a fair deal but this Health Secretary has slammed the door on urgent talks. ",1,libdems
