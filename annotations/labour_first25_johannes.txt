2	Desperately need more health visitors to ensure people can stay at home *& not take up hospital beds . Also checking more on new borns at home to help new parents adjust to huge demands of parenting. District nurses can pick up on early signs of dysfunctional families / child abuse and neglect. Hopefully then be able to provide support services. As such reducing the huge increase in baby deaths at hands of parents. / step parents 💔	neg

3	What has the tories prehistoric capitalism done for us in over 40yrs? Apart from stealing all our industry which WE paid for and sold off on the cheap to their mates, they have put us TRILLIONS in debt while they are the richest they HAVE EVER BEEN. Everything crumbling from the NHS to the roads which are a disgrace🤬so keep voting for the tories thieving capitalism and keep the 1% very happy ! NO CLAUSE 4, NO LABOUR PARTY.	neg

4	Nothing can be guaranteed 💯. Perhaps rephrase and say "We will try"	neu

7	Admirable stuff but they’re setting themselves up for a fall. You can tax all you like but it’s not going to magic 🪄 up the staff to fulfil these promises   neu

8	In your local elections vote 💚 green. Don't let the Tories be they blue or red privatise the NHS	neu

9	What will Labour pay these Doctors and nurses? 🤔 It needs to be a lot closer to what they are asking for. So far Labour have not said what they will do with regards to pay.	neu

11	Phew a lot of financial quotes here..including

quantitive easing
....wow....NHS ????
but
Best of all the deputy leader of the Labour Party, for the whole of 2023, so far. has said. Nothing.
Our "street talking" Ange has kept her comments to herself, and 'got on' with the hundreds ? of jobs, she get expenses for, within her remit.
Go Girl...........
😞 sorry
or what ever gender she chooses at this time.
Him,They, It, Us, Whom. SNP 👎	neg

12	STARMER says wage request of Junior Doctors is “unaffordable”

▪️He's on the side of the Tories	neg

13	Voting for the Labour Party and their really excellent candidates in local and general elections and getting them elected to majority power will be the way these issues are addressed and eventually remedied. The ballot box is the way to rid us of the Tories and 13 years of poverty, punishment and pain inflicted on us by them. If you want a fairer society, vote Labour every time.

14	Labours NHS was £6.9trillions (today’s rates) in defecit within 12 months of its existence and NO Government was ever been able to balance the books and find the NHS properly..... and a LIEBOUR Government wontvbe able to either so stop the 🐂💩	neg

15	What do you propose to do to rectify this? It won't happen overnight 🤔  neu

16	The Labour Party are you going to wave a magic wand 🪄. You need to beware of offering too much that is unachievable you can tax all you want but it’s not going to get the staff you require any time soon  neg

17	Think we are missing what's really happening the tories would love to privetise the NHS it's already started 🤔  neu

18	Yeah 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏  pos

19	And how will this be achieved by voting Labour in the upcoming local elections? 🤨	neg

20	I hate the Tories always been labour but would they be able to do any better in the current situation. People are scared to be ill. Have a fall. Heart attack. Stroke. Because the ambulance wouldn't reach them on time. It's all so sad what we have become. I know a elderly lady who had a fall broke her pelvis and she walked somehow down to the hospital. The staff said they don't know how she did it she must have been in so much pain. 😪	neg

21	Is anyone convinced with this 💩?	neg

22	Maybe you need to accept responsibility also for the support you provided the government with covid measures that led to huge NHS backlogs and waiting lists in the first place ? Maybe accept responsibility for your support of compulsory vaccination that has led to an increase in heart attacks and strokes too ? . The whole lot of you have blood on your hands and it will take more than a few false promises to put right what you helped cause 😭 x  neg

23	RIP. To all those innocent people. 🙏🙏🙏	neu

24	🙏💔	neu

25	Never forget the Holocaust, a major lesson from history and mankind’s shame 😔	neu
