0,How can you grow the economy with you bunch of tossers and ofgem ripping us off.. nobody with half a brain cell would set up shop in UK 😡,2023-01-30T16:21:44+0000
1,Staff leaving the sector in droves! Nobody wants to work for the peanuts being offered & the long term debt training in the NHS inflicts on staff. They are really living in a parallel world this lot. 😡,2023-01-30T10:47:22+0000
2,Great 5000 beds between more than 1250 hospitals. Those 4 beds per hospital will make all the difference 🙄 Please take what remaining nurses we have left in our hospitals for your grand plan. Not like we have a staffing shortage right now.,2023-01-30T17:47:30+0000

5,"Can you PLEASE PLEASE do something about all of our gas heating bills. I’ve never known it to be so high. So expensive.We are getting help for  Our electric, and not our gas. I’ve received a one off payment some time ago. Nothing since. The gas board seem very proud of their MASSIVE PROFITS. I feel we are being ripped off.

14,Absolutely right not to forget. Its a shame though the victims of the Kamir Rouge and the attrocities during the 2nd world war of the Japanese et al dont get the same respect. 🤔,2023-01-27T14:33:01+0000
15,It's all just words. There are have been so many years of a lack of investment and neglect. We are in catch up mode. Ask anyone in the profession they will give you and accurate representation of the current situation. I think you will find there is a lot of concern about what the future holds. Check out Question Time Last week..embarrassing 😡,2023-01-23T19:29:26+0000
16,What utter bullshit... I deal with folks with MH needs daily... And currently have a few complaints waiting... Due to negligence in your NHS units... And two inquests to attend of young men under 30.. Who would still be here if professionals had stuck to protocols!! 😡,2023-01-30T04:14:41+0000
17,Do you have to be a Tory voter😀,2023-01-23T19:57:58+0000
18,As a lifelong Conservative and still a paid up member I can assure you that in my opinion there are absolutely no Brexit benefits. Also the Party has split into factions and those in groups such as the ERG are extremely dangerous. In Richi Sunak we have a good Leader now but the Party is currently beyond repair😩,2023-01-23T15:14:20+0000
19,These benefits - are they going to be kept a secret for much longer cos people are getting curious 😂,2023-01-23T13:55:51+0000

25,"I partly understand the government opposition to putting cash into Britvolt, however even a 50 % investment would only be approx half of the £5B lost through fraudulent covid business grants 🤔",2023-01-19T10:20:16+0000
26,"People need to stand back and think. A tremendous amount of money borrowed to help people and get us through COVID this has to be paid back. The country doesn’t have a bottomless pot of money. Do these strikers think they are the only ones finding life difficult at the moment. What would happen if shop workers all decided to walk out!!! Unions could bring this country to its knees, and I think that is what Labour want 😡😡😡",2023-01-19T06:47:30+0000
27,"This is terrible spin doctoring. By your leader.  It’s not about paymasters; he’s a fine one to shout that out on money he’s got! No, it’s about people having the right to a fair wage and reasonable standard of life, just like an MP! I really am disliking this man more on daily basis 🤬",2023-01-19T05:40:05+0000
28,"And yet at the same time plummeting towards becoming a third world country full of debt, strikes and food banks 😡",2023-01-18T08:09:47+0000
29,"People still won't be satisfied and will still moan! This country is full of victims with the wrong mentality. Instead of finding a way to be apart of the growth they want to find a way to put it down or take from it.   Great job Rishi, keep up the good work👍",2023-01-18T11:36:42+0000

33,ow if you could just ensure they were paid properly and had decent conditions🤔🤔,2023-01-17T19:37:37+0000
34,"Conservatives are trying to takeaway all of our rights, quite happy for huge companies like P & O to sack all their staff and March people in on a fraction of the wages, no sick pay, less holidays etc… that’s the world they want! They can find billions for bogus contracts to give to theirs pals,but not to give hard working people an honest pay rise 🤷‍♂️ People need to wake up!",2023-01-17T09:35:49+0000

37,"Yes how awful, Labour standing up for workers rights! Imagine how much more corrupt you Tories will become once you can shaft the workers even more 🤔",2023-01-16T23:14:24+0000
38,Labour are on the side of the workers unlike this hard right wing Tory government who are to blame for the mess we are in 😡,2023-01-16T23:24:23+0000

42,I wish he was running the show! The only issue I have is that he is (or was) a Brexiteer which doesn’t make sense given his role. The EU have a lot of legislation to protect workers rights🤷‍♂️….all of which the tories want to put on the bonfire according to ReesFogg.,2023-01-17T10:28:20+0000
43,"To currently cover minimum levels in the nhs they have to use agency staff, lots of agency  staff. So I'm curious to see what the plan is for future strike days when you can't even cover it now. 🤔",2023-01-16T19:05:06+0000
44,Great! Minimum service levels would be a great start to ensuring that patients have the correct number of staff available per shift. Is your plan that this happens everyday or just when staff strike? Because I feel you have a duty to make sure it's every day.   The staff will be very pleased to know that you'll be providing extra staff to achieve this! Maybe everyday needs to be a strike day! 🙂,2023-01-19T09:18:35+0000
45,"Protecting patients, commuters and keeping children in school by running down the services and putting more and more pressure on the workers.. uhmmmm 🤔😔",2023-01-18T09:57:06+0000
46,Good work 👏   People have the right to strike from work if they wish but they shouldn't be allowed to stop others from working. This should have been done years ago,2023-01-16T13:38:13+0000

65,"Fantastic work Conservatives! It was a work of genius to introduce Christmas shopping and a World Cup drinking session as part of your manifesto. Maybe we could make it an annual thing where everyone spends loads of their yearly savings over the space of a few weeks? That international football competition drinking session would probably have to be every other year though, I’m not sure the nations livers could take it.

Yes, of course the A & E Depts. are under pressure because hundreds of them have closed completely or are not open 24/7 and the population is out of control! What happened to the fairy story about 40 new hospitals by 2030? Why don't you tell people that this does not mean NEW HOSPITALS, or a major refurbishment and alteration. It may be a major new clinical building on an existing site or a new wing of an existing hospital . Where will you find the doctors, nurses and GP's. ? It will never happen!

If the doctor/ nurse would have the information I have already given so many times, they can save 80% of their time. The organisation itself is so complex that all NHS departments have many different spreadsheets just to understand who is responsible for what part and what should happen next, at least 50% of time can be saved here.

Never yield to force; never yield to the apparently overwhelming might of the enemy. We stood all alone a year ago, and to many countries it seemed that our account was closed, we were finished. All this tradition of ours, our songs, our School history, this part of the history of this country, were gone and finished and liquidated.  Very different is the mood today. Britain, other nations thought, had drawn a sponge across her slate. But instead our country stood in the gap. There was no flinching and no thought of giving in; and by what seemed almost a miracle to those outside these Islands, though we ourselves never doubted it, we now find ourselves in a position where I say that we can be sure that we have only to persevere to conquer.”  Speech to Harrow, 1941 🥃🇬🇧",2022-11-30T19:52:48+0000
